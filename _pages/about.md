I am a first-year master's student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ia.cas.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, machine learning.

I was very fortunate to be mentored by researcher Hao Jie from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
